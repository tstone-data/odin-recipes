        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This easy Lasagna Recipe is meaty, cheesy, and packed with flavor in every bite.
        Homemade lasagna is better than any restaurant version and it feeds a crowd for way less than going out to eat.</p>
        <p>We love lasagna around here and have gotten creative over the years with Lasagna Soup and even Chicken Lasagna,
        but we’ve heard again and again from our readers that this is the best lasagna recipe they’ve ever made.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine 16 oz Cottage Cheese, 15 oz Ricotta, 1 cup mozzarella, 1 egg and 2 Tbsp parsley. Mix well.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Preheat oven to 375˚F. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add salt and 9 lasagna noodles.</p>
                <p>Cook until al dente according to package instructions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Spread 1/2 cup meat sauce in the bottom of a deep 9×13 casserole dish.</p>
                <p>Add 3 noodles, spread on 1/3 of the meat sauce, and sprinkle with 1 cup mozzarella cheese.</p>
                <p>Spoon on and spread the top with 1/2 of your cheese sauce.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Repeat until you have 3 layers of noodles.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Poke 9-12 toothpicks over the surface of your lasagna (to keep the foil from sticking to the cheese).</p>
                <p>Cover with foil and bake at 375˚F for 45 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Remove foil and broil for 3 to 5 minutes, or until cheese turns golden.</p>
                <p>Let lasagna rest 30 min before slicing.</p>
