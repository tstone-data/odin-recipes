        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Just a glance at the hundreds of reviews in the comments section tells me that this recipe is a favorite for many others too!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp cornstarch</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1.2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 large egg + 1 egg yolk</li>
            <li>2 tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Whisk the flour, baking soda, cornstarch, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In a medium bowl, whisk the melted butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together until no brown sugar lumps remain.</p>
                <p>Whisk in the egg and egg yolk. Finally, whisk in the vanilla extract. The mixture will be thin.</p>
                <p>Pour into dry ingredients and mix together with a large spoon or rubber spatula. The dough will be very soft, thick, and appear greasy.</p>
                <p>Fold in the chocolate chips. The chocolate chips may not stick to the dough because of the melted butter, but do your best to combine them.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Cover the dough tightly and chill in the refrigerator for at least 2–3 hours or up to 3 days.</p>
                <p>I highly recommend chilling the cookie dough overnight for less spreading.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Take the dough out of the refrigerator and allow it to slightly soften at room temperature for 10 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Preheat oven to 325°F (163°C). Line large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Using a cookie scoop or Tablespoon measuring spoon, measure 3 scant Tablespoons of dough.</p>
                <p>Roll into a ball, making sure the shape is taller rather than wide—almost like a cylinder. This helps the cookies bake up thicker.</p>
                <p>Repeat with remaining dough. Place 8–9 balls of dough onto each cookie sheet.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Bake the cookies for 12–13 minutes or until the edges are very lightly browned.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
